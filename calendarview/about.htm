We are a group of Human-Computer Interaction and Design students at EIT ICT Labs Masterschool. Other than improving the relationships between technology and humans we like innovation and entrepreneurship.
In early 2013 we got the idea to improve the Google Calendar since we had trouble getting a good overview to choose our elective courses based on how busy we were in our regular calendar.

The result is <C3>. 

C3 adds a yearly view to your Google Calendar. Colors range from light to dark, depending on how busy you are.
C3 was originally developed during courses in Information Visualization and Interaction Programming at KTH, The Royal Institute of Technology, in Stockholm, Sweden. 

C3 is based on:
D3.js
Mike Bostock's calendar view
etc

It is free for educational and non-commercial use.

We currently work from Sweden but we are an international team originally from Britain, China, Russia and Sweden and we speak 9 languages.
